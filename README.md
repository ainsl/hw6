pong.js is my recreation of Pong

pong-sound.js is Pong with sound effects for when the puck hits one of the paddles, when the puck bounces off the top/bottom of the screen, and when the puck goes off the screen and someone scores a point. The sound files are whooshSound.m4a, bounceSound.wav, and pointSound.wav.

pong-colors.js is Pong with a different color scheme. When the puck hits a paddle, the paddle color changes momentarily.

pong-realistic.js is Pong with the background made to look like an air hockey table.
